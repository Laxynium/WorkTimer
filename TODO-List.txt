 - Add switch which will install the BurntToast pwsh module
 - Improve handling the errors when command fails
 - Refactor this try catch block
 - Consider splitting it into separate objects
 - Consider some abstraction which would help to send notification based on operating system
   or more precisely on installed tools on machine
 - Add github action which will create nuget, consider using nuke
 - Think about dealing with versions, maybe use a semantic versioning, with nuke it should be quite simple
